# High Order Splitting Methods for Commutative SDEs

This repository contains code for the paper "High order splitting methods for SDEs satisfying a commutativity condition", by James Foster, Gon&ccedil;alo Dos Reis and Calum Stange (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17543).

The `presentation` folder contains slides describing the methodology.

The `scripts` folder contains the code for the different SDE experiements (CIR model, noisy anharmonic oscillator and stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo model). Code for underdamped Langevin dynamics can be found at https://github.com/james-m-foster/high-order-langevin.
